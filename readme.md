# Project

## Travel Dash

This repository has been setup to track progression of Travel Dash as it gets a facelift--moving to a React frontend with a Node.js backend and associated API. This move will allow for enhanced functionality and a suite of additional features. 

My focus on this project is to create with scalability in mind. I am diving deeper into system design and architecture as I work, so full disclosure--the current status of the code might be considered a bit ugly.

## Description

The frontend uses Themesburg's Volt free and open source Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard. It serves as the base template for the react app--allowing Travel Dash to use a modern UI/UX focused design. The components will be heavily customized to adapt to the focus of Travel Dash, with plenty of original components and additional features added on to its base. 

The Node.js w/Express backend is being converted into a true backend API for communication with the frontend. 

The tech stack is evolving as the project grows, with the most current addition being Redux for help with state management on the frontend. 

This project is early in its development phase, and thus not functional yet. View the project management kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/JeremySeckinger/projects/1)
