# Project

## Travel Dash

This repository has been setup to track progression of Travel Dash as it gets a facelift--moving away from Handlebars and the MVC architecture to React on the frontend with a Node.js backend and associated API. This move will allow for enhanced functionality and a suite of additional features

## Description

The frontend uses Themesburg's Volt free and open source Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard. It serves as the base template for the react app--allowing Travel Dash to use a modern UI/UX focused design. The components will be heavily customized to adapt to the focus of Travel Dash, and additional features will be added on to its base. 

The Node.js w/Express backend is being converted into a true backend API for communication with the frontend. 

The tech stack is evolving as the project grows, with the most current addition being Redux for help with state management on the frontend. 

This project is early in its development phase, and thus not functional yet. View the project management kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/JeremySeckinger/projects/1)
